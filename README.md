Started this Repo after joining the  Eternagames.
Their Eterna scripts inspired me.
I began writing html pages and using them locally.
I enter RNA sequences into input text boxes.
The page has a submit button that goes to a javascript function.
The function saves the input(s) as variable(s).
Calculations are done and the results are sent back to the html page.
